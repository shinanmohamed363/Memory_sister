Then, while talking, Tharu opened up about what she loves, why she needs to earn money, what drives her. And she came to that point - her father's story.

At that time, our relationship was too close‚Äîcloser than anyone else in my life. She trusted me with her deepest pain.

As she started to tell her father's story, I looked only at her eyes. I saw the pain, the struggle, the weight she's been carrying all alone.

In that moment, I felt like someone took a sharp knife and cut my heart into pieces. The pain was unbearable. It was very, very painful to me.

My throat tightened. My chest felt heavy. I couldn't even talk with her. Words failed me completely.

All I could think was - I want to do something. I NEED to do something. I can't just sit here while my little sister carries this burden.

I really cried inside. Tears I couldn't show. Pain I had to hide. But inside, I was breaking.

Her strength amazed me. Her father's struggle broke me. Her family's pain became my pain.

At that moment, I made a silent promise - I will be there for her, always. I will help carry this burden with her.

I'll never forget that evening. I'll never forget the look in her eyes. I'll never forget how helpless I felt.

But I also promised myself - I will never let her face this alone. She has me now. She has her brother.

Your father is a warrior, Tharu. And you are his brave daughter. I'm proud of you both.`}

{`Before I go abroad, every moment with you becomes more precious. I try to meet you as much as I can, to see your smile, to hear your laugh, to make you happy. Because I know distance will keep us apart physically, but never emotionally.

Every single moment I spend with you is not just time - it's a golden treasure I'll carry in my heart forever.

I want to say to you, my Tharu, my little princess - keep these memories always with you. Close to your heart. Forever.

I really love you. More than you can imagine. Wherever I go in this world, whatever I do, I'm always talking with you, thinking about you, my sister.

Distance will never change that. Oceans cannot separate our bond.

I'll try to go after graduation, Insha Allah. But before that day comes, I'll do everything I can to help you get work, to secure your future, to make your dreams come true.

Because your success is my success. Your happiness is my happiness.

I love you. I wish I had better words to express these feelings that overflow from my heart. But words feel so small for emotions this big.

---

Every single time when you talk with me, I feel blessed. I feel like I have the best person in my life that others can only dream of having.

You are rare, Tharu. You are special. You are a blessing.

Whatever you do, wherever you go, always remember me. Because I will never, EVER forget you.

Even if I have tons of work, even if I'm exhausted, even if the world is falling apart - I will always ask you what you're doing. Always check on you. Always care for you.

---

I love to see you grow up, succeed, and get the position you truly deserve in life. You deserve all the happiness in this world.

Your growth will be my pride. Your achievements will be my joy.

---

If I ever hurt you in any situation, please forgive me, my sister. Every mistake haunts me. But know this - I never meant to cause you pain.

I love you with all my heart. This love is pure, eternal, unconditional.

---

Memories never die. They live forever in our hearts, in our souls.

When you miss me, when you feel alone, when you need your brother - just go through this. Read every word. Feel every emotion.

This is how I see you in my world.

You are not just my little sister. You are my pride, my joy, my reason to work hard, my reason to become better.

You, your parents, your father, your whole family - you all hold a special place in my heart.

And you, Tharunya, you are my hidden diamond. My precious treasure. My little princess.

Never forget - you are loved beyond measure. You have a brother who will always fight for you, protect you, care for you.

Until we meet again, keep smiling, keep shining, keep being the amazing person you are.

I love you, thaggam. Forever and always. üëëüíé`}
