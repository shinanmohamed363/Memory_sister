I said, "Whose laptop is this?" Then he said, "This is Nuha's one." That was the first time I heard your name.

When I fixed it, you came and sat next to me. I never looked at you. I just focused on your laptop and taught my friend what this error was and how to fix it. But I never looked at your face.

I said it was a joke, but you said, "You don't understand, Shinan. My mama is too strict. Don't kid like that." At that moment, you were too serious.

I didn't say anything. I felt too guilty inside. My heartbeat raised up too much.

Kamil brought you and made you calm down. Then you called me, wanting to talk with me. At first, I said, "I won't talk with you."

Then you grabbed me and talked with me. That was my first time touching a girl's hand other than my sister and my baba. My body was getting shivery inside. I felt too uncomfortable.

You said, "I look at you like my father. I always cry easily. You are too personal to me."

At that time, I felt something inside. It's not love, but I felt like a bond.

You said, "After my ex and Kamil, I'm hugging you. I'll never forget those words at that time." You said your father was not with you‚Äîhe went abroad. I felt you were so caring.

You said you cry for different reasons, not because of me. You told me about your past, about your ex.

But you were more than a listener. You became my strength when I was weak, my hope when I was lost.

At that moment, I realized - blood doesn't make family. Love does. Care does. Being there for each other does.

After that fight, I cried the entire night. Tears soaking my pillow, heart breaking with every breath. Yes, it was my fault. I know. I own it. But let me tell you something that burns in my soul every single day:

You are not just in my life. You ARE my life. You sit at the highest throne in my heart, my princess. Nothing - NOTHING - comes before you.

If anything happened to you, if I lost you, if pain touched you - I wouldn't survive it. That's not exaggeration. That's the raw, naked truth.

---

You want to know why I keep asking "Are you eating or not?"

It's not nagging. It's not control. It's because...

Every time I sit down to eat, your face flashes before my eyes. I see you - working hard, pushing yourself, forgetting to eat. And suddenly, the food in my mouth tastes like ash.

I can't swallow. I can't enjoy a single bite knowing you haven't eaten.

So I wait. I hope. I pray that you've eaten. Because only then can I eat in peace.

Don't tell me "Ask Tharunya if she ate, then I'll eat." No, baba. That's not how this works.

I need BOTH of you. You're not replaceable. You're irreplaceable.

You might be "just a person" to yourself, but to me? You're my emotional anchor. My safe place. My reason to care so deeply that it hurts.

That's why I get possessive. Not to control you, but because losing you would destroy me.

I love asking about you. I NEED to ask about you.

Please... understand what you mean to me.

---

Some nights, I can't sleep. I just think about you. I talk to Allah about you.

Do you remember that night? You were crying when I was at Kamil's home. My heart shattered hearing your voice break.

All I wanted was to run to you. To hold you. To tell you everything will be okay.

You told me your life felt like hell. You shared the wounds from your childhood, the scars from love, the pain you've carried silently for so long.

In that moment, I died inside.

It was the hardest, most painful moment of my entire life. My strong sister, my warrior, breaking down... and I couldn't reach you.

I will NEVER forget that night. Never.

---

And here's my promise to you:

Even if you walk away from me tomorrow. Even if you decide you don't need me anymore. Even if you forget my name.

I will STILL be there for you.

In sickness, in struggle, in sadness, in success - I won't let you face anything alone.

Your health, your happiness, your career, your dreams - I will fight for all of it as if it were my own.

Because you have a brother whose love has no conditions, no limits, no end.

---

By the way... remember that cream you suggested from Yara production? Ahahaha! It's actually working! My face is getting brighter!

See? Even in small things, you make my life better.

You, my sister, in my tiny world, you hold the biggest space. You're the sun everything revolves around.

I wish I could see you right now. I want to see that hand that got hurt last time we met. I want to hold it gently and promise it will never hurt again.

---

Every night, I raise my hands and pray:

"Ya Allah, guide my precious sister Nuha on Your straight path.

Heal what's broken deep inside her soul. Mend the wounds no one else can see.

Give her the health and strength she deserves - because she's fought battles no one knows about.

You know her suffering. You've counted every tear. You know what's hidden in her heart - every hope, every fear, every dream.

Ya Allah, place someone in her life who will cherish her like nobody ever has.

A partner who will keep her smiling until her last breath on this earth and reunite with her in Jannah's eternal gardens.

Make her the best daughter to her superhero father - the man who sacrificed everything for his family.

And Ya Allah, bless her with a future so bright, so beautiful, that it erases every shadow of her painful past.

Ameen."

---

Listen to me, Nuha:

You deserve the ENTIRE world. The moon. The stars. Everything beautiful.

Not because of what you've survived - though that makes you incredible.

But because of WHO YOU ARE.

You're a fighter with the softest heart I've ever known.
You're a giver who keeps giving despite your own empty cup.
You're a believer who kept faith when life gave you every reason to quit.

You. Are. Extraordinary.

---

I love you, my sister.

Not by blood - but by CHOICE.
Not by chance - but by Allah's PERFECT plan.

You were meant to be in my life. And I was meant to love you, protect you, care for you.

This is not a phase. This is not temporary.

This is forever, thaggachiii.

Forever. üíñ`}

{`Before I go abroad, every moment with you becomes more precious. I try to meet you as much as I can, to see your smile, to hear your laugh, to make you happy. Because I know distance will keep us apart physically, but never emotionally.

Every single moment I spend with you is not just time - it's a golden treasure I'll carry in my heart forever.

Love you so much, Nuha. More than you'll ever know.

I'm always there for you - across oceans, across continents, across any distance this world can create.

---

I am the luckiest person in this world to have you as my sister in my life. Not everyone gets a blessing like you.

I love you more than everyone in my life. These are not just words written on a screen - they are feelings carved deep in my soul.

I'll never forget these moments, thaggachiiiii. They are the best parts of my life.

---

I really love you. Wherever I go, whatever I do, I'm always talking with you, thinking about you, my sister.

Distance may separate us, but it will never break our bond.

I'll try to go after graduation, Insha Allah. But before that, I'll try my best to help you get work, to make your dreams come true. Because your happiness is my happiness.

I love you. I wish I had better words to express these feelings that overflow from my heart.

---

Every time you talk with me, I feel blessed. I feel like I have the best person in my life that others can only dream of having.

Whatever you do, wherever you go, always remember me. Because I will never forget you.

Even if I have tons of work, even if the world is falling apart, I will always ask you what you're doing. Because you matter more than anything else.

I love to see you grow, succeed, and get the position you deserve in life. Your success will be my success.

---

If I ever hurt you in any situation, please forgive me. Every mistake I made haunts me. But know this - I never meant to cause you pain.

I love you, my sister. This love is pure, eternal, and unconditional.

---

Memories never die. They live in our hearts forever.

When you miss me, when you feel alone, just go through this. This is how I see you in my world.

You are not just my sister. You are my strength, my hope, my reason to smile.

You, your parents, your father - you all hold a special place in my heart.

And you, Nuha, you are my hidden diamond. The most precious treasure of my life.

Never forget - you are loved beyond measure. üíé`}
